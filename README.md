# Soccer-Database-Management
Soccer database management projects presents unique MS SQL server backend with frontend developed in Microsoft PowerApps. 

**Project Demo URL:** https://video.syr.edu/media/t/1_niyvyvxd

## Objective
* Soccer Data Conceptual & Logical Modeling
* Soccer Data Acquisition
* Historical Soccer Data Understanding
* Microsoft PowerApps Visualize Soccer Data (External Layer)
* Audience anyone interested in knowing about current Soccer leagues/players/teams.

## Data Modeling

* **Conceptual Data Modeling**
    * In this phase, we understood our data requirements and defined our problem formally.
    * We prioritize our requirements according to the business needs.
    * We identified our entities with attributes and relationships among themselves.
    * We drew a Crow’s Foot E R diagram and using that, designed our Logical Model.
      
      **Entities**

      **Relationships**

* **Logical Data Modeling**
    * In this phase, we implemented our Conceptual Data Model using a relational database model.
    * So, we defined our tables, columns, keys and constraints.
    * We mapped the entities to tables and mapped the attributes.

## Summary

* Created a database that a person can use for keeping track of Soccer matches held in 8 leagues in USA.
* Our objective was to make available players info, managers info, teams info so that a team can see players’ and managers’ rating and their performance and decide to make a bid for the player.
* The database structure is quite simple and scalable, which makes it easy for also other programmers to understand it.
* While doing this project we understood this information can be used for understanding existing soccer data. We can leverage this information to perform predictive analysis and reporting.
* Gained deeper understanding on database design and how it can be implemented in real life situations using Microsoft PowerApps.


## Learning Objectives Achieved

* How to understand the data requirements as per business needs and classifying them into functional and non-functional requirements.
* How to implement logical model and map the entities to tables and map the attributes.
* How to acquire data and create a scalable database.
* How to ensure Data Integrity within a database.
* How to make a presentation layer using Microsoft PowerApps to cater to business requirements.
